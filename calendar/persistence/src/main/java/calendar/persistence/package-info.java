/**
 * Provides core functionality for the persistence layer in the application.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes and interfaces for handling data access and
 * storage. The persistence layer serves as a bridge between the application's
 * ui logic and the underlying restAPI, ensuring data consistency and efficient
 * access.
 * <h2>Package Overview</h2> The {@code calendar.persistence} package includes
 * the following primary components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link calendar.persistence.persistence} - The main entrypont for the
 * persistance layer. Contains a read and write method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Usage</h2> This package is intended to be used by the core modual to
 * access, create, update, and delete data in the database.
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2> The {@code com.example.persistence} package depends on
 * the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code calendar.types} - Defines custom data types and domain-specific
 * classes, such as event types, schedule formats, and user preferences, used
 * across the application.</li>
 * <li>{@code com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation} - Provides annotations for
 * controlling JSON serialization and deserialization of entities and custom
 * types. This helps in defining JSON structures when saving and loading data.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code com.fasterxml.jackson.core} - Contains core classes for handling
 * JSON parsing and generation. This dependency enables efficient data
 * transformation between objects and JSON, a common format for data
 * interchange.</li>
 * <li>{@code com.fasterxml.jackson.databind} - Supports data binding between
 * Java objects and JSON, enabling flexible configuration for serialization and
 * deserialization logic. This module is essential for converting entity objects
 * to JSON and vice versa.</li>
 * <li>{@code com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310} - Provides support for Java
 * 8 date and time (JSR-310) types, such as {@code LocalDate} and
 * {@code LocalDateTime}, within the Jackson serialization framework. It ensures
 * seamless JSON conversion of modern date/time types.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since   1.0
 * @version 1.0
