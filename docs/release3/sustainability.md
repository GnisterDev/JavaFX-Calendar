### Social Sustainability

Trust:

The app collects user information for account creation and login, which necessitates secure data handling to maintain user trust. If users perceive the app as reliable in terms of privacy and data security, it can foster stronger trust in the service.
Level: Systemic (since data protection policies and practices influence long-term trust).

Inclusiveness and Diversity:

By offering a user-friendly, intuitive design, the app can be accessible to a wide range of users with different ages, backgrounds, and technical abilities.
Level: Immediate (through accessible design and functionality).

Equity:

The system treats all users equally without differentiated access to features, ensuring fair and consistent experiences across the user base.
Level: Systemic (through universal design principles), or immediate?.

### Individual Sustainability

Health:

The calendar app can positively impact mental health by helping users stay organized and reduce stress associated with planning.
Level: Immediate (in user experience) and Enabling (for better time management).

Lifelong Learning:

The app promotes organizational skills, time management, and digital literacy as users navigate the app's features. These skills contribute to personal development over time.
Level: Enabling (by fostering time management and organization skills).

Privacy:

The app collects personal data for account management, so protecting user data is paramount. Implementing strong privacy policies ensures user identity and calendar data remain secure.
Level: Systemic (data management policies impact long-term privacy).

Safety:

Since the app is primarily digital and not directly involved in physical safety, it does not present significant safety risks. However, potential data breaches could affect users’ sense of digital safety.
Level: Systemic (data protection enhances the digital safety of users).

### Environmental Sustainability

Materials and Resources:

Depends alot where the application ends up being hosted.

As a digital application, the calendar app does not require physical materials. However, it may impact server usage and energy consumption if hosted on large-scale infrastructure.
Level: Systemic (through server energy demands and the resources required for cloud infrastructure).

Pollution:

Minimal direct impact since it’s a virtual application, but data centers where it’s hosted can contribute to environmental impacts, including emissions from non-renewable energy sources.
Level: Systemic (through the data center’s environmental impact).

Biodiversity and Land Use:

The app has no direct impact on land use or biodiversity, though its hosting service might have indirect effects, depending on its environmental policies.
Level: Systemic (if the hosting provider affects land use or biodiversity).

Energy:

Server usage, especially as the app scales, requires careful consideration of energy demands. Opting for hosting providers that use renewable energy sources can mitigate the environmental impact.
Level: Systemic (energy usage affects sustainability long-term).

Logistics and Transport:

The app does not have physical logistics needs but can reduce the need for travel by helping users coordinate schedules remotely.
Level: Immediate (reducing travel needs by facilitating remote scheduling).

### Economic Sustainability

Value:

The app generates value by enhancing productivity, potentially saving users time and improving personal or business efficiency.
Level: Immediate (by directly offering users an efficiency tool).

Innovation, R&D:

Future development and improvements to the app can lead to new features and create potential revenue streams. Investments in R&D could thus be financially beneficial.
Level: Systemic (for long-term R&D investment and innovation impact).

### Technical Sustainability

Maintainability:

Code should be maintainable over the long term, with regular updates to address bugs and compatibility with new operating systems or hardware.
Level: Systemic (sustaining maintainability over time).

Usability:

The app should be intuitive and accessible, enhancing productivity and user satisfaction. Consistent updates based on user feedback can further improve usability.
Level: Immediate (through user interaction) and Enabling (by simplifying time management).

Extensibility and Adaptability:

Design choices (e.g., using cross-platform frameworks) can affect the ease with which new features are added. For example, supporting a web app ensures adaptability across devices.
Level: Systemic (by making future updates easier).

Security:

Security is essential to protect user data and maintain trust. Implementing strong access controls and encryption ensures that only authorized users access sensitive data.
Level: Systemic (since security impacts user trust long-term).

Scalability:

Scalability is critical if user demand grows; the app should be capable of handling increased workloads. Cloud-based infrastructure could support this flexibility.
Level: Systemic (to handle growing user demands sustainably).
