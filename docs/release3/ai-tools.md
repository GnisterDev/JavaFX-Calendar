# AI statement

We used generative AI tools to assist in answering code-related questions. Rather than copying code directly from the AI's responses, we used them as a starting point or source of inspiration to save time.

AI was also very helpful in adding Java documentation throughout the project. A typically tedious task that became much simpler with AI assistance. We carefully reviewed all the documentation ourselves to ensure everything is accurate and aligned with our standards.
