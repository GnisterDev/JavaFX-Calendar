# AI statement

We have used generative AI tools to assist in answering code related questions. We tried not to copy code directly from the AI's answer, but rather to use the answer as a jumping off point/inspiration to save some time.

We also found AI very useful when adding java documentation for the whole project, this is tedious task that been made alot simpler with AI. We have of course gone through all the documantation ourself, and made sure everything is how it should be.
