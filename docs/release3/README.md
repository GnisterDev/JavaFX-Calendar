### Project architecture

### Work habits

We havent changed our work habits alot since release 2 other than creating issues that are bit more spesific. We had created issues which were quite broad for release 2, this created some problems for when trying to program parallell to eachother ([Explained in greater detail under Work habits in release 2](../release2/README.md)).

### Code quality

We have installed checkstyles
Added java documentation for the whole project.

### Test coverage

We have good test Coverage for the whole project, We are missing some test coverage for calendarController and popUpController. The reason is because we could not find a way to mock the the ui changes that happen when we add and edit an event.
