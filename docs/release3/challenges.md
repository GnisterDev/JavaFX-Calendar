# Working with Module Architecture

In our code project, one of our biggest challenges we faced was working within a modular architecture.

### Key Challenges:

- **Dependency Manegment and POM files**

  Small changes to one POM file lead to issues that impacted other modules, especially as dependencies updated or conflicts became apparent between different versions.

- **Integrating modules**

  Integrating small modules into larger once proved to be time consuming and required lots of troubleshooting. Each module had to be compatible with all other modules, which made errors difficult to identify and resolve.

### Approchehes we tried:

To address these challenges we tried several approaches:

- **Pair programming**

  By working in pairs, team members were able to intergrate their modules more seamlessly due to more understanding of that module. Each issue that became apparent could also be identified more quickly, especially those that came up during the integration. This reduced the time spent on individual troubleshooting and provided an additional layer of review to catch dependency and compatibility issues.

- **Documentation of each module**

  We created documentation for each module, explaning its functionality and dependencies. This made it easier for team members to understand the workings of each module, which in turn simplified the integration process, helping everyone to understand how the modules would work together.

### Lesson learned:

Through these challenges, we learned several valuable lessons on working in a team:

- **Pair programming (Collaboration)**

  Collaborative approaches, like pair programming were beneficial, allowing us to address integration issues more efficiently and leveraging collective problem-solving skills.

- **Documentation is essential**

  Making documentation for each module not only helps during integration but also ensures that future development or troubleshooting can proceed more easly. Documentation, while time-consuming, saves time by providing clarity where this would be more time consuming.

- **Modular Architecture requires lots of planning**

  We learned that modular development requires a much more structured approach to planning and version control, especially as more modules are added and intergraated. By addressing these aspects from the start, we could of minimized complications later in the development process.
